description: "<h2>General</h2><p>The ORAN SC A1 Policy Management Service\
    \ provides a REST API for managing A1 policies. <br/>This document describes the latest API set 
    \ to perform tasks for: </p><ul><li>A1 Policy creation, modification and deletion.</li><li>Monitoring\
    \ and maintaining consistency of the SMO view of A1 Policies and the Near-RT RICs</li><li>Maintaining\
    \ a view of each Near-RT RIC's supported A1 Policy Types</li><li>Supervision of registered services\
    \ (rApps). When a registered service is unavailable, its policies are removed.</li></ul><h2>APIs\
    \ provided or defined by the service</h2>\
    \ <p>Note: parts of this API are strongly based on extracts of the O-RAN Alliance R1 Interface specification\
    \ for A1 Policy Management, and those parts should be considered 'Copyright (C) O-RAN ALLIANCE - All rights reserved.'</p>\
    \ <h3>A1 Policy Management</h3>\
    \ <p>This is the latest API for managing A1 Policies. This API is partially compliant with O-RAN\
    \ Alliance R1 Interface specifications for A1 Policy Management:</p><ul><li>A1 Policy retrieval, creation,\
    \ modification and deletion.</li><li>Retrieval of supported A1 Policy Types for\
    \ a Near-RT RIC</li><li>Retrieval of status for existing A1 policies</li></ul><h3>Management\
    \ of configuration</h3><p>API for updating and retrieval of the component configuration.\
    \ Note that there other ways to maintain the configuration.</p><h3>Service Callbacks</h3><p>These\
    \ are endpoints that are invoked by this service. The callbacks are registered\
    \ in this service at service registration.</p><h3>NearRT-RIC Repository  (Older version)</h3>\
    \ <p>This is an API that provides support for looking up a NearRT-RIC. Each A1 policy\
    \ is targeted towards one Near-RT RIC.</p><h3>Health Check</h3><p>API used for supervision\
    \ of the A1 Policy Management Service.</p><h3>Service Registry and Supervision</h3>\
    \ <p>API used for registering services/clients/rApps. Each A1 Policy can be tagged with an owner.\
    \ If the owner service is registered, then the service can be optionally monitored by a heart-beat supervision\
    \ mechanism, and if the registered service becomes unavailable, then it is removed and all its A1 Policies are\
    \ deleted. Note that services do not need to be registered to create A1 Policies, but unregistered\ 
    \ services are not supervised. This is a feature that is optional to use.</p>"
